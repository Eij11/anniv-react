          <p>
            From the moment I confessed my love for you, from the moment that is
            today. I really am grateful for you sticking around.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even though we weren't able to meet today. I do hope for the coming
            days we'll be able to do so. I want to experience things with you
            more.Â 
          </p>

          <p>
            We still have to go to that staycation; we haven't eaten my fried
            mushrooms; we haven't gone swimming to Nambalan.
          </p>

          <p>
            'Because of you, I have become one'; it's not an exaggeration to say
            that you complete me. As we achieved this milestone, I hope we, from
            now on, would create more memories together.
          </p>

          <p>With all my love, Eljon Pogi</p>
